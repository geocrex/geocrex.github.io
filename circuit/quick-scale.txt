-- URL: https://github.com/VideoPlayerCode/mpv-tools
--
-- Description:

--  Quickly scale the video player to a target size,
--  with full control over target scale and max scale.
--  Helps you effortlessly resize a video to fit on your
--  desktop, or any other video dimensions you need!
--
-- History:
--
--  1.0: Initial release.
--  1.1: Do nothing if mpv is in fullscreen mode.

--
-- Parameters:
-- targetwidth = How wide you want the target area to be.
-- targetheight = How tall you want the target area to be.
-- targetscale = If this is 1, we use your target width/height
--   as-is, but if it's another value then we scale your provided
--   target size by that amount. This parameter is great if you want
--   a video to be a certain percentage of your desktop resolution.
--   In that case, just set targetwidth/targetheight to your
--   desktop resolution, and set this targetscale to the percentage
--   of your desktop that you want to use for the video, such as
--   "0.25" to resize the video to 25% of your desktop resolution.
-- maxvideoscale = If this is a positive number (anything above 0),
--   then the final video scale cannot exceed this number.
--   This is useful if you for example set the target to 25%
--   of your desktop resolution. If the video is smaller than that,
--   then it would be scaled up (enlarged) to the size of the target.
--   To control that behavior, simply set this parameter.
--   Here are some examples:
--    -1, 0, or any other non-positive number: We'll enlarge
--      too-small videos and shrink too-large videos. Small videos
--      will be enlarged as much as needed to match target size.
--    1: Video will only be allowed to enlarge to 100% of its natural size.
--      This means that small videos won't become big and blurry.
--    1.5: Video will only be allowed to enlarge to 150% of its natural size.

    targetwidth = tonumber(targetwidth)

    local scale = (widthscale < heightscale and widthscale or heightscale)
